After a quick tour of Sails, ory / hydra, OAuth and uPort, I think Sails is very friendly to beginners. Sails is easy to set 
up and easy to browse. Just follow the steps to design a complete and beautiful page. Although Sails still has many functions 
that I am not familiar with, I followed the tutorial given by the teacher and some instructions given on github. I set up 
Sails and created a new Sails project. And made me enter the welcome interface.

I didn't have any particular obstacles in this process, I just followed the teacher's video and the introduction on Sails. 
I think Sails is really suitable for beginners.
