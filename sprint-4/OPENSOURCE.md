The biggest difference between the two articles is the motivation to participate in the open source project. The first article
focuses on people's inner motivation. These internal motives such as interest, community awareness and desire for money. The 
second article focuses on the motivation from external stimuli. For example, how open source projects can be more beneficial 
to their careers and companies. I think these two articles give me a deeper understanding of open source projects, such as 
why so many people participate in open source projects. I also think that the open source project may allow many people who 
are interested in it to find a balance between interest and money.
